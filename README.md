In order for the config / plugins to work, rename 'tempname' to '.obsidian' . Github wouldn't let me upload the original '.obsidian' file because it was a hidden file. After that, simply open the folder just above '.obsidian' as your vault(named 'Obsidian-Vault-Template', not 'main'). You can move this folder wherever you'd like, open obsidian, and then tell obsidian where your vault location is. You can also rename the vault ofc.

None of the plugins are written, created, or affiliated with me. I just use them. The only work I've done is exclusively in configuring hotkeys and creating basic note templates.
