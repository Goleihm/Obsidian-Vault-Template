In order for the config / plugins to work, rename 'tempname' to '.obsidian' . Github wouldn't let me upload the original '.obsidian' file because it was a hidden file. After that, simply direct obsidian to the location of the folder next to this readme file as your vault -- the folder above '.obsidian' (named 'Obsidian-Vault-Template', not 'main'). You can move this folder wherever you'd like, open obsidian, and then tell obsidian where the new vault location is. You can also rename the vault ofc.

None of the plugins are written, created, or affiliated with me. I just use them. The only work I've done is exclusively in configuring hotkeys and creating basic note templates.
