In order for the config / plugins to work, rename 'tempname' to '.obsidian' . Github wouldn't let me upload the original '.obsidian' file because it was a hidden file. After that, simply open the folder just above '.obsidian' as your vault(named 'Obsidian-Vault-Template', not 'main'

None of the plugins are written, created, or affiliated with me. I just use them. All the work I did was exclusively in configuring hotkeys and creating basic note templates.
