In order for the config / plugins to work, rename 'tempname' to '.obsidian' . Github wouldn't let me upload the original '.obsidian' file because it was a hidden file.

None of the plugins are written, created, or affiliated with me. I just use them. All the work I did was exclusively in configuring hotkeys and creating basic note templates.
